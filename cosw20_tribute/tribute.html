<h2 id ="athlete">Athlete</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/kaepernick7?lang=en" target="_blank">Colin Kaepernick</a> is a free agent quarterback, who played six seasons in the NFL for the San Francisco 49ers. <a href="https://www.biography.com/people/colin-kaepernick-21132801" target="_blank">Born in 1987</a> to a single mother in Milwaukee, Wisc., Kaepernick would then be placed for adoption and spent the majority of his formative years in Turlock, Calif., where he excelled in football, baseball and basketball at John H. Pitman High School. He earned an athletic scholarship to play football at the University of Nevada, Reno.</p> 
    
<p>After four seasons at Nevada, Kaepernick was selected in the second round of the <a href="http://www.nfl.com/draft/history/fulldraft?season=2011" target="_blank">2011 NFL Draft</a>, spending his rookie season in San Francisco as a backup to Alex Smith. He became the team's starting quarterback during the 2012 season after Smith went down with a concussion. With Kaepernick at starter, the 49ers won the NFC Championship to advance to Super Bowl XLVII, but fell to the Baltimore Ravens by a score of 34-31.</p>
<center><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/ec52d1227643597d84f57c761594f8a7/tumblr_inline_ntpkbrZn4i1qesbxs_500.jpg" alt="Kaepernick's signature bicep kiss celebration"></center> <p>Kaepernick followed up that magical run with a solid 2013 campaign in his first full season as a starter. He threw for 21 touchdowns and rushed for four to spark San Francisco to a 12-4 regular season finish. The 49ers came up one win short of a return-trip to the Super Bowl, losing to the NFC West rival Seattle Seahawks, 23-17, in the conference title game. Kaepernick's stellar season earned him a six-year contract extension with the 49ers.</p>
    
<p>However, Kaepernick's playing career would never again reach the height of his run to the Super Bowl. The 49ers finished 8-8 in 2014 and missed the playoffs. He lost his starting job halfway through the 2015 season after the 49ers' 2-6 start. In 2016, the last season he played in the NFL, Kaepernick found himself as the subject of scrutiny, but not for his on-field performance or the team's results.</p>

<p>Before a preseason game against the Green Bay Packers on Aug. 26, 2016, Kaepernick remained seated during the playing of the "Star-Spangled Banner", instead of standing with fellow teammates. Kaepernick told reporters after the game that his gesture was meant as a protest to raise awareness of police brutality and other injustices against people of color. <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/49ers/2016/09/01/colin-kaepernick-national-anthem-protest-police-socks/89743344/?hootPostID=247417f150320acbc9febf92b5e7fd48#" target="_blank">Kaepernick decided to kneel</a> for the 49ers' final preseason game on Sept. 1 out of respect for US servicemen, while still protesting racial inequality. Other players around the NFL followed suit by also taking a knee during the season.</p>
<center><img src="https://cdn-s3.si.com/s3fs-public/styles/marquee_large_2x/public/2017/09/15/colin-kaepernick-nflpa-charity-community-mvp.jpg" alt="Colin Kaepernick" width="60%" height="60%"></center>    
<p>Although the 49ers went 1-10 in the 11 games he started, Kaepernick still threw for 16 touchdowns to only four interceptions in 12 total regular season appearances in 2016. He opted out his contract after the season, <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/the-49ers-wouldve-cut-colin-kaepernick-if-he-hadnt-opted-out-of-his-contract/" target="_blank">amid reports the 49ers would have cut him had he not opted out</a>. His ongoing free agent status has since raised speculation over whether he is being blackballed by NFL owners for his protests during the anthem and media attention surrounding them. News coverage of Kaepernick's protest somewhat flew under the radar in 2017 until President Donald Trump evoked his name at a rally in Alabama, while delivering a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6FaVrW2leo" target="_blank">tirade against athletes who took a knee during the national anthem.</a> To show solidarity against Trump's remarks, teams across the NFL staged protests during the national anthem on Sept. 24, 2017. Protests came in various methods such as kneeling, locking arms or remaining in the locker room during the rendition.</p>
    
<p>Athletes and coaches in other US sports used their visible platform to criticize the president and his policies. The Golden State Warriors' Stephen Curry voiced opposition to his team visiting the White House, opting not to continue the tradition that previous championship-winning teams in US sports have participated in. San Antonio Spurs head coach <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/2017/9/25/16360694/nba-players-respond-national-anthem-protests-nfl-donald-trump-stephen-curry" target="_blank">Gregg Popovich said the US is "an embarrassment to the world,"</a> referring to the controversies surrounding Trump.</p>

<p>It is not certain if Kaepernick will ever play another snap in the NFL. But he has emphatically left his mark on sports and society, by re-opening discussions about the the <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/2016/9/11/12869726/colin-kaepernick-national-anthem-protest-seahawks-brandon-marshall-nfl" target="_blank">role of athletes in social activism</a>, as well as the debate over the traditional practice of performing the national anthem at sporting events.</p>

<h2 id="impact">Impact of protest on other US sports</h2>
<ul>
    <li><p><strong>National Basketball Association:</strong> On Sept. 30, 2017, Los Angeles Lakers players locked arms during the national anthem before tip-off of their first game of the 2017-18 preseason. Head coach Luke Walton said the team plans to lock arms during the anthem throughout the season. NBA rules state that <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/2017/9/25/16358070/national-anthem-protest-kneel-kneel-rule" target="_blank">players and coaches are required to stand</a> for the national anthem before games. Although no NBA player of note has taken a knee post-Kaepernick, members of the <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/2017/9/24/16358276/los-angeles-sparks-wnba-finals-national-anthem-protest-game-1-minnesota-lynx" target="_blank">WNBA's Los Angeles Sparks</a> remained in the locker room during the anthem before a WNBA Finals game.</p></li>
     <li><p><strong>Major League Baseball:</strong> Oakland Athletics catcher Bruce Maxwell became the <a href="https://www.si.com/mlb/2017/09/24/bruce-maxwell-anthem-protest" target="_blank">first MLB player to kneel during the national anthem</a>, at a home game against the Texas Rangers on Sept. 23, 2017. As an African-American and son of a US Army veteran, Maxwell's protest was viewed as groundbreaking in a sport whose demographics and culture lean more white and conservative than the NFL or NBA. Only 7.7% of MLB players are African-American.</p></li> 
  <li><p><strong>US Soccer:</strong> On Sept, 4, 2016, Megan Rapinoe of the United States women's national soccer team and NWSL's Seattle Reign FC became the first white athlete to kneel during the national anthem out of solidarity with Kaepernick. “Being a gay American, I know what it means to look at the flag and not have it protect all of your liberties," Rapinoe said. US Soccer has since added a <a href="https://www.starsandstripesfc.com/2017/9/26/16371086/us-soccer-stands-by-policy-standing-national-anthem-rapinoe-kneeling" target="_blank">new policy to its association bylaws</a>, mandating that participants of  the men's and women's national teams stand for the US anthem before official matches. However, officials of Major League Soccer, the top men's pro league in the US, <a href="https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2017/09/26/mls-players-union-react-ongoing-conversation-regarding-right-protest" target="_blank">released a statement</a> voicing support for players' rights to protest.</p>

Although MLS has not had any notable protests during the anthem, the league has always been progressive when it comes to social issues.

Crowds at MLS games normally display rainbow flags and anti-racism banners during matches.</p></li>
